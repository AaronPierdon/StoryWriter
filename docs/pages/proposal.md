# Proposal

This product will help a user write a story. The user can do so with the help of a text editor, data entry forms that help create story objects, like a character, and provide an analysis of infomration that has been input into the program, like associations between characters. One result of this analysis could be text-completion during text editing; another could be a timeline of graphic and interactable objects, like events.
