This product will help a user write a story with text, create story objects with data entry forms, and provide a graphical representation of all the data input that is intuitive to navigate yet dynamic in the amount of insight it provides about the story. Timelines, associations, and more can be understood with this graphic, analytical tool. It would be nice to have the program's text editing portion benefit from data input. For instance, if a user inputs character sally with associations with fredrick, the program should provide code/typing completion during text editing as well as some other neat features undetermined at this point. Let's make writing a story fun, easy, and unique.
