Today, I will
1. Finish design documents.
2. Investigate/Inquire about what you can do in regard to the needs of the project... don't worry, I'll find something for everyone.
3. Divide the tasks and assign a task with some references to related design documents.
4. Of course, make sure everyone is comfortable with said assigned task(s).

// Exactly what we will be doing over the next few months
In very general terms, we are making a program that has 3 segments at the moment:
1. Data Entry for story objects
2. Text Editor for creating chapter content
3. Data Mining that uses story objects and maybe textual, chapter content.

// What we are doing over the next few days/weeks
***Currently, we are focusing on segments 1 & 2. 
Data mining designs and tasks will take place after developing and testing segments 1 & 2.*** (edited)
